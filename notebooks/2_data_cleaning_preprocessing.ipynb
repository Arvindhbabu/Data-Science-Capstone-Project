Launch was shifted to the new Ariane 6 rocket, but the program was delayed.[378] On the previous Galileo launch, the booster was expended due to a lack of fuel for a landing. However, that launch provided data that allowed SpaceX to make design and operational changes to recover the booster on this launch. The company said this landing attempt would test the bounds of recovery.[377]'\n",

Wilmore and Sunita Williams, the crew of the Boeing Crew Flight Test, joined the Crew-9 and Expedition 72 crew complement.[383] The second stage experienced an off-nominal deorbit burn that ran for an extra 500 milliseconds, and while it landed safely in the ocean, it landed short of the targeted area.[384] SpaceX said they would temporarily halt launches while time was spent understanding the root cause. Several days later the FAA said they would require an investigation into the failure before issuing a return to flight for the Falcon 9. It marked the third time in a span of three months that the Falcon 9 suffered an anomaly temporarily stopping launches.[385][386] On October 11, the FAA approved the Falcon 9 to return to flight for low-Earth orbit missions, after granting approval for the Hera launch due to its heliocentric orbit.[387]'\n",

By analyzing the crater formed and the momentum transferred during the impact, Hera will help validate the kinetic impact method as a potential strategy for deflecting a near-Earth asteroid on a collision course with Earth. The mission will provide data on the efficiency of this technique. It also carries two nano-satellite CubeSats, called Milani and Juventas. This was the second booster to complete its 23rd flight. Although the Falcon 9 remained unable to launch following the Crew-9 mishap, the FAA granted an exemption for the Hera launch, as it did not involve a second-stage reentry.[389] First stage was expended because all of its performance were needed to go to the heliocentric orbit.\"\n",
